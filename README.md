About the same jupyter notebooks from the Coursera course with the same name, refurbished.

### Caveat
- <code><b>fit_generator()</b></code> method introduced in the video has become <b>deprecated</b> in the later/newer tensorflow2 versions. Simply use <code><b>fit()</b></code> which can deal with generators as well now.
